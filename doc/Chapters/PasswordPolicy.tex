Passwords must be at least 15 characters long, with at least two upper case letters, two lower case letters, two numbers, and two special characters. They must expire after 60 days and contain at least two characters not in the previous password. Running \texttt{set\_passwd\_policy.sh} will automatically change these settings.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change the password expiration settings. Open \texttt{/etc/login.defs} and set these variables:
	\begin{verbatim}
	PASS_MAX_DAYS   60
	PASS_WARN_AGE   7
	\end{verbatim}

\item Set the password requirements. Open \texttt{/etc/security/pwquality.conf}. Negative values indicate that that number of the thing be present in a new password:
	\begin{verbatim}
	difok = 2
	minlen = 15
	dcredit = -2
	ucredit = -2
	lcredit = -2
	ocredit = -2
	minclass = 4
	maxrepeat = 2
	usercheck = 1
	\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}
