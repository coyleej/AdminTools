\subsection{MANTIS} \label{subsec:installMANTIS}

Note: MANTIS can (and will if you use the script) be installed prior to S4, but S4 is a required dependency. MANTIS will not work properly unless S4 is installed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clone MANTIS from github:

	\texttt{cd /home/<admin>/Code} \\
	\texttt{git clone https://github.com/harperes/MANTIS.git}

\item Make sure that the system \texttt{pip} is installed. If you skip this bit, then \texttt{sudo} won't find \texttt{pip3}\dots

	\texttt{sudo apt install python3-pip}

\item Install MANTIS to \texttt{/opt}

\texttt{cd MANTIS} \\
\texttt{sudo pip3 install . --target="/opt" --no-deps --no-dependencies}

\item Open \texttt{/etc/environment}:

	Prepend \texttt{/opt/MANTIS} to the system path.
	
	Make sure that \texttt{/opt} has been added to PYTHONPATH.

\item Create or activate an s4py environment. 

\item Test the install. Navigate to the MANTIS \texttt{tests} directory and type:
	
	\texttt{python -m unittest}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Signac} \label{subsec:installSignac}

Setup is automated in \texttt{repo\_download\_w\_some\_setup.sh}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clone Signac from github and check out the develop branch:

	\texttt{cd /home/<admin>/Code} \\
	\texttt{git clone https://bitbucket.org/glotzer/signac.git} \\
	\texttt{cd signac} \\
	\texttt{git checkout develop}

\item Make sure that the system \texttt{pip} is installed. If you skip this bit, then \texttt{sudo} won't find \texttt{pip3}\dots

	\texttt{sudo apt install python3-pip}

\item Install MANTIS to \texttt{/opt}

%\texttt{cd signac} \\
\texttt{sudo pip3 install . --target="/opt" --no-deps --no-dependencies}

\item Open \texttt{/etc/environment}:
	
	Make sure that \texttt{/opt} has been added to PYTHONPATH.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{S4} \label{subsec:S4compiling}

\texttt{repo\_download\_w\_some\_setup.sh} downloads the necessary machine learning repositories (pybind11, OpenBLAS, and S4), but compiling is left to the user.

Please refer to Eric Harper's S4 installation instructions. If you have access to the MANTIS folder, you can direct your browser to \url{file:///home/<User>/<PathToSyncFolder>/MANTISBIBLE/S4Documentation/html/install.html}. If not, please see the \href{https://github.com/harperes/S4}{harperes S4 repository on github}.
