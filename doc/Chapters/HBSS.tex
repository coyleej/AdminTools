We must install HBSS and update the policies. The installation script is called in \texttt{set\_passwd\_policy.sh}. Contact me for the current installation script. If you wish to call it separately, do so with the following:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo bash <install>.sh -i && /opt/McAfee/cma/bin/cmdagent -c
\end{verbatim}
